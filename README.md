A 3D nardy game written in Rust on OpenGL 4.6, the Rust version of the C++ game with the same rules, computer player, graphics and interface: long nardy, the game of the Caucasus and Central Asia, and short nardy, known in the West as backgammon. The computer opponent judges positions with small neural networks it taught itself by playing millions of games.

There is no game engine, and no model, texture or sound file: the board, the checkers and the dice are built in code at startup, the wood, leather, felt and stone are procedural, the lighting environment is baked on the GPU, and the sounds are synthesized. The shaders and the networks are built into the executable, so the game is a single file.

## Features

### Games

- **Long nardy** (длинные нарды): fifteen checkers each on the «head», both sides running the same way round the board. A single checker holds a point; only one checker may leave the head a turn, two on a first roll of 6-6, 4-4 or 3-3; no six points in a row may be held unless an opponent's checker is already past them. A win is one point, two for a mars, when the opponent has borne off none
- **Short nardy** (короткие нарды, backgammon): the sides run against each other, a lone checker is hit to the bar and must enter the opponent's home before anything else moves. A win is one point, two for a mars (gammon), three for a koks (backgammon)
- Both: a double is played four times, both dice must be played when they can be, the higher one when only one can, and the checkers are borne off once all fifteen are home
- The players throw a die each to see who starts; in short nardy those two dice are the first roll

### The computer player

- Judges every way of playing a roll by the position it leaves: a network of 200 inputs, 64 hidden units and three outputs, the chances of winning, of winning a mars and of losing one. One network for each game, about 50 KB each
- Taught by temporal-difference learning, as TD-Gammon was: it played against itself over a million games of each kind, nudging its judgement of each position toward that of the next. It beats a sensible greedy player in about 94 games of 100 at short nardy and practically always at long nardy
- Five levels, from Novice to Master. The lower levels misjudge on purpose, Novice by much, and now and then plays a random move; Master also looks a roll ahead: for its eight best moves, every one of the 21 rolls the opponent may answer with and the opponent's best reply
- Thinks on a thread of its own, then plays its steps one by one; the hint is Master's advice
- `tools/train.rs` is the program that teaches the networks; see [Teaching the networks](#teaching-the-networks)

### Play

- Click a checker, then where it goes, or drag it there; the places it may reach glow, with one die or several in turn by the same checker, and the dice still to play are listed. A double-click plays the higher die
- Only legal steps are offered, and every step leaves a way to play the whole roll by the rules; clicking a checker that may not move says why: a checker on the bar to bring in first, or the head already left this turn
- Take back a step with a right click or `Backspace`, the whole turn with **Undo**, or go back to an earlier turn of yours and play it again with the same dice
- The hint shows the computer's best move on the board and in words; asked for again, it plays it
- The dice thrown with `Space`, a click on the board, the button, or by themselves
- Play against the computer, two players on one computer, or watch a demo game
- The moves in the notation players write: `24/18`, `13/7*` for a hit, `bar/22`, `6/off`, `13/7(2)`; the pips left and the checkers borne off; the score over the games
- The game in progress, its history and the settings kept between sessions
- Two views: an overview from White's side and one from above. The camera also turns with the right mouse button and zooms with the wheel
- English and Russian interface, chosen from the system language
- Sounds mixed on a thread of their own: dice shaken and bouncing, checkers set down, knocked off and dropped into the tray; full screen, awareness of the screen's scale, a dark title bar
- No work while nothing moves: the game waits for input instead of drawing the same picture

### Graphics

- Physically based shading: GGX highlights, a clear coat on the checkers, the dice and the box, image-based lighting from a procedural room with a lamp over the board
- Soft shadows (PCSS); HDR rendering with 4× MSAA, bloom, ACES tone mapping and vignette
- A board of two fields with the points inlaid and edged with a thin line, drawn by the shader and filtered over each pixel; mitred rims, the middle bar, and a tray beside it where the checkers borne off stand on edge
- Checkers turned of wood, stone, bone or plastic, with a raised rim, a carved groove and a rosette; dice with rounded edges and sunken pips
- Animation: the dice thrown across the board, bouncing and tumbling to rest on the numbers rolled and darkening as they are played; checkers flying in arcs, lifted when chosen, a lone one knocked off to the bar, borne off ones turning on edge into the tray
- Marks on the board: where the chosen checker may go, which checkers may move, the last move, and the hint
- Four themes: Classic (a light wooden field with dark and red points in a walnut box, ivory and ebony checkers), Oriental (red leather with a gold line, a lacquered box, bone and onyx), Tournament (green felt, black lacquer, red precision dice) and Night (dark leather, slate points and a silver line, pearl and black stone)
- An interface of frosted-glass panels, sharp at any screen scale

A new game starts at once when the game is changed; changing the game or who plays starts the score again.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11, or Linux (X11 or Wayland), x64
- A graphics card and driver with OpenGL 4.6 (4.5 is enough)
- Rust 1.85 or later (the 2024 edition); on Linux also the ALSA development files (`libasound2-dev` on Debian and Ubuntu)

## Building and running

```sh
cargo run --release
```

The executable is `target/release/nardy3d` (`nardy3d.exe` on Windows) and runs on its own. The settings and the game in progress are kept in `Nardy3D.ini`, in `%APPDATA%\Nardy3D` on Windows and in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Nardy3D` (`~/.config/Nardy3D`) on Linux.

## Teaching the networks

The networks in `assets` are built into the game; `tools/train.rs` teaches such networks anew, or better ones. It plays the game against itself with the same rules and the same network code as the game, and every 25 000 games measures the network against a greedy player or a network given, and saves it:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin train -- short 800000 assets/short.net
cargo run --release --bin train -- long 300000 assets/long.net
cargo run --release --bin train -- long 400000 long2.net assets/long.net assets/long.net 0.3
cargo run --release --bin train -- long compare long2.net assets/long.net 4000
```

The third line goes on teaching a network at a lower rate and measures it against the one it started from; the last plays two networks against each other. A game takes a few milliseconds, so a network is taught in minutes. The game must be built again to take in new networks.

## How a frame is drawn

1. **Shadow map** — the box and every checker and die seen from the lamp's key light, for soft shadows; the checkers and the dice in two instanced draws.
2. **Main pass** — the table, the box, the felt of the tray and the fields in HDR with 4× MSAA, lit by the key light and the baked environment. The points, their lines and the marks of the game are drawn on the fields by their shader, filtered over each pixel. The checkers and the dice follow from one storage buffer, then the room behind.
3. **Post-processing** — the samples are resolved, bright parts spread into a six-level bloom, and the composite pass applies tone mapping and vignetting and frosts the glass behind the interface panels.
4. **Interface** — panels, text and icons, drawn on top.

The environment maps are baked with compute shaders when the theme changes, and the BRDF table once at startup.
